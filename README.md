# dobox
my exploration of the dobox 

Kickstarter link: 

Indigogo link:

My observations:
Beta app through testflight gives access to filesystem and config of Lan and Wifi. 
My HDMI seems to only display red, so I hope it is working. 
I can't seem to get the SD card to read directly.
Doing a ncrack scan on the ssh server causes the device to error out and show yellow leds.
It is not clear what video file formats are supported.
Banners show the device may be running ubuntu.
API interface seems to run Node.js Express framework.
